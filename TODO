* Replace cam dict with dataclass
* Save plots when processing finishes (handle key press event in matplotlib)
* Check different resizing of the image and other interpolation algorithms (is it needed? is performance affected by full-resolution images?)
* Test with more than 2 cameras
* Calibration phase - learn the background to handle cases when person enters the FOV but stands still. Remember about changing lightning conditions.
* KPIs:
  - Save frames to files - csv?
  - Load them as numpy array
  - Label data where motion occurs
  - Calculate metrics to find the best thresholds
* Add debouncing - when threshold is exceeded, save images for n frames even if threshold is not exceeded again.
* GUI
